# Integer-Palindrome

## Description
The logic of the program is 
The program checks if given Integer is palindrome or not. An integer is called palindrome if it's equal to its reverse, e.g. 1001 is a palindrome, but 1234 is not because the reverse of 1234 is 4321 which is not equal to 1234.

## How the program works
The project contains two classes main and IntegerPalindrome, the IntegerPalindrome class contains a method called isPalindrome, where it check if a given parameter is a 'palindrome integer' or not.

In-order to execute the program run "main.java" 

## Dependancies and tools used
* Version of Java: JDK 13.0.2 https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk13-downloads-5672538.html
* JUnit test dependancy: JUnit 5.6.0 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api

## Highlights 
* Works well and returns the correct output.
* Better code efficiency
* Good use of stringbuilder

## Imrovements 
* The number of tests done is limited and it can be improved.
